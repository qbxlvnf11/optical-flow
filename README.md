Description
=============

#### - Optical Flow
  - The pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera
  - It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second
  - Details about optical flow: see blog posting in References section below

#### - Sparse Optical Flow vs Dense Optical Flow 
  - Sparse optical flow: computing the optical flow using the information about the corner location
  - Dense optical flow: computing the optical flow for all the points in the frame
