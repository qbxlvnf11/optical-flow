Description
=============

#### - Optical Flow
  - The pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera
  - It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second

#### - Dense Optical Flow (Gunnar Farneback's Algorithm-Based)
  - Computing the optical flow for all the points in the frame
